        <h3><b>Mass Protests Erupt in Nepal as "Gen Z" Movement Topples Government
        </b></h3>
        <p> Nepal is navigating a period of profound political upheaval 
            after a youth-led, anti-corruption protest movement, dubbed the "Gen Z protests," 
            culminated in the resignation of Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli and the dissolution of his government. 
            The unprecedented wave of demonstrations, which saw tens of thousands of young people take to the streets, 
            has resulted in the appointment of former Chief Justice Sushila Karki as interim Prime Minister, 
            marking a pivotal moment in the nation's recent history.</p>
        <p>
            The immediate trigger for the mass protests was the government's decision in early September to impose a 
            sweeping ban on popular social media platforms. However, 
            this move proved to be the spark that ignited a much larger powder keg of public frustration.
             For months, discontent had been simmering among Nepal's youth over systemic issues of government corruption, 
             a culture of political impunity, high unemployment,
             and severe economic hardship.

            "They shut down the civic space of our generation," said one 26-year-old protester in Kathmandu. 
            "But this is about more than just social media. It's about our future, 
            which we see being stolen by a corrupt and out-of-touch political class."

            The initially peaceful demonstrations took a violent turn on September 8th when armed 
            police fired into crowds of protesters, leading to numerous fatalities. The tragic events
             galvanized the movement, transforming it from a protest into a nationwide revolt. In the days that followed, government buildings, 
            including the historic Singha Durbar which houses the parliament, were set ablaze, 
            and the private residences of several high-ranking officials were targeted.

            The scale and intensity of the unrest, which resulted in over 70 deaths, brought the government to a standstill.
             Following tense negotiations between the President, the army, and representatives of the protest movement, 
             Prime Minister Oli stepped down. An interim government, led by the widely respected anti-corruption crusader Sushila Karki,
              was sworn in, with new elections anticipated to be held in March of next year.

            In the aftermath, a tense calm has returned to Kathmandu, though the military presence remains visible. 
            The interim government has established a three-member probe committee, headed by a former Supreme Court judge, 
            to investigate the protest-related deaths and the violence that ensued. The committee has been given three months to submit its report.

            While the immediate crisis has subsided, the underlying issues that fueled the protests remain unresolved. Interim 
            Prime Minister Karki has called for calm and national unity, but her government faces the immense challenge of addressing the
             deep-seated economic and political grievances of the population before the country heads to the polls. The world now watches to see if 
             this powerful youth-led movement can translate its revolutionary success into lasting democratic and economic reform for the Himalayan nation.
